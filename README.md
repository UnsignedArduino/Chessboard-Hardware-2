# Chessboard-Hardware-2

Hardware for a magnetic-piece-tracking digital chessboard! WIP

This repository contains the KiCad PCB project for the rest of the Chessboard's wiring.

## Notes

### Models

All models were modified in Fusion 360. 

* Raspberry Pi Zero WH was modified from [Julian's model](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-zero-w-1)
  and combined with "${KICAD8_3DMODEL_DIR}/Connector_PinSocket_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinSocket_2x20_P2.54mm_Vertical.step"
  from the KiCad 3D model library.
